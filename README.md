# Neon Memory Game

## React + TypeScript + Vite

## Description

The Neon Memory Game project is a classic card-matching game designed to test and improve your memory skills. It challenges players to find matching pairs of cards within a set of face-down cards.

Disclaimer: I'm including the .env file in the repo since it is private in order to make the initial setup easier but feel free to change it.
